map 5:
HIDDEN SUPPLIES
Reconnaissance units have uncovered a hidden cache of materiel in this war zone.

In the Place Objective Markers step, players must set up one additional objective marker in No Man’s Land.

Before setting up this new objective marker, players must first move the objective marker in the centre of the battlefield 6" directly towards one of the corners of the battlefield (if No Man’s Land touches any of the corners of the battlefield, you must move the objective marker towards one of those corners). Otherwise, the players roll off, and the winner selects which corner the objective marker is moved towards. Players then set up the new objective marker 6 from the centre of the battlefield towards the diagonally opposite corner of the battlefield to the previously moved objective marker.


SECOND BATTLE ROUND ONWARDS
WHEN: End of the Command phase (or the end of your turn if it is the fifth battle round and you are going second).

The player whose turn it is scores VP as follows (these are cumulative):
5VP If they control one objective marker not within their deployment zone.
5VP If they control two objective markers not within their deployment zone.
5VP if they control more objective markers than their opponent controls.
